/*
Write a class Statistics with two static methods:
• public static double mean(ArrayList<Measurable> list) and
• public static double standardDeviation(ArrayList<Measurable> list) that compute the mean value and the standard deviation 
of a non-empty ArrayList
of elements.
The mean value μ (or arithmetic average) is computed by summing up the elements and dividing by the number of elements.
The standard deviation σ is defined as the square root of the average quadratic difference of the elements from the mean value. 
In formulae this is for n elements a1, . . . , an (with   standing for sum, corresponding to a for loop):
